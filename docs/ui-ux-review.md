# UI/UX Review (Backlog)

## High-impact (next)
- Replace `YOUR-DOMAIN-HERE` in `index.html`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` with the production domain before launch.
- Swap emoji service icons for a consistent SVG icon set (keeps the “premium” feel and avoids mixed rendering across devices).
- Add a lightweight “New Patient” section (what to expect + how to schedule) once the owners approve final wording.
- Add conversion tracking (basic analytics + click tracking for `tel:` and directions links).

## Medium (soon)
- Add a simple appointment request form (Netlify Forms / Formspree / preferred vendor) to reduce friction for non-call users.
- Add FAQ content + `FAQPage` JSON-LD once approved (helps SEO and reduces front-desk repeat questions).
- Replace the Google reviews link with a direct “Write a review” + “Read reviews” pair (uses the practice’s official Maps place URL).

## Nice-to-have (later)
- Add a “Conditions We Help” section (only with owner-approved language; avoid medical claims).
- Add a light/dark theme toggle if desired (not required, but can help late-night readability).
- Run an automated a11y pass (axe) and contrast check before final launch.
